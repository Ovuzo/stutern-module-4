        Technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale that has
        never been realized in the history of mankind. The idea that <i>something I
        create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future</i> is what
        drives my passion and love for Technology.

          So far in my frontend jurney in this <b>internship</b>, i have learnt the
          underlisted topics:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Introduction to Git and Github</li>
          <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
          <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">
          The topic i am currently on is CSS. Css is what <b>beautifies</b> the web
          page, without css a web page will not have all the aesthetics web
          pages have, in the css, one can add color to both the text and
          background. There <i>padding, marging and other formattings can be used
          to beautify the html file</i>.
        </p>

    <section id="sec3">
        <!-- <header>Third section</header> -->
        <p class="p1">Padding, marging and borders are used for formatting html file, Below are thier <b>differences</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Padding: An element's padding is the space between its content and its border. The padding property is a shorthand property for: <i>padding-top. padding-right. padding-bottom.</i> </li>
            <li>Marging: Margins control the spacing width between the edges of your web page and the element itself. The following are the four property options: <i>margin-top. margin-right. margin-bottom.</i></li>
            <li>Border: The border property is a <i>shorthand syntax</i> in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to.</li>
        </ul>
